``mlab``: Python scripting for 3D plotting
============================================

.. topic:: Section summary

    This section describes the `mlab` API, for use of Mayavi as a simple
    plotting in scripts or interactive sessions. This is the main entry
    point for people interested in doing 3D plotting Ã  la Matlab or IDL
    in Python. If you are interested in a list of all the
    functions exposed in mlab, see the :ref:`mlab-reference`.

.. currentmodule:: mayavi.mlab

The :mod:`mayavi.mlab` module, that we call mlab, provides an easy
way to visualize data in a script or from an interactive prompt with
one-liners as done in the matplotlib_ ``pylab`` interface but with an
emphasis on 3D visualization using Mayavi2. This allows users to perform
quick 3D visualization while being able to use Mayavi's powerful
features.

Mayavi's mlab is designed to be used in a manner well-suited to
scripting and does not present a fully object-oriented API.
It is can be used interactively with IPython_.

.. warning::

    When using IPython with mlab, as in the following examples, IPython must
    be invoked with the ``--gui=qt`` command line option like this::

         $ ipython --gui=qt

    On recent versions of IPython, this can be turned on from within IPython
    itself by::

        In []: %gui qt

    If the following exception is raised::

        ValueError: API 'QString' has already been set to version 1

    This is the result of incompatible setups between PyQt and PySide. The
    solution is to run ``QT_API=pyqt ETS_TOOLKIT=qt4 ipython``. 
    More details can be found at the `ipython documentation page`_.

    If for some reason Mayavi fails with the Qt backend, you can also try
    using the wxPython backend by doing::

        $ ETS_TOOLKIT=wx
        $ ipython --gui=wx

In this section, we first introduce simple plotting functions, to create
3D objects as representations of `numpy` arrays. Then we explain (1) how
properties such as color or glyph size can be modified or used to
represent data; (2) how the visualization created through `mlab` can
be modified interactively with dialogs, (3) how scripts and
animations can be ran. Finally, we expose a more advanced use of `mlab`
in which full visualization pipeline are built in scripts, and we give
some detailed examples of applying these tools to visualizing volumetric
scalar and vector data.
