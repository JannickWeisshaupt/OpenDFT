animate
~~~~~~~

.. function:: animate(func=None, delay=500, ui=True)

    
    ::
     A convenient decorator to animate a generator that performs an
            animation.  The `delay` parameter specifies the delay (in
            milliseconds) between calls to the decorated function. If `ui` is
            True, then a simple UI for the animator is also popped up.  The
            decorated function will return the `Animator` instance used and a
            user may call its `Stop` method to stop the animation.
    
            If an ordinary function is decorated a `TypeError` will be raised.
    
            **Parameters**
    
            :delay: int specifying the time interval in milliseconds between
                    calls to the function.
    
            :ui: bool specifying if a UI controlling the animation is to be
                 provided.
    
            **Returns**
    
            The decorated function returns an `Animator` instance.
    
            **Examples**
    
            Here is the example provided in the Animator class documentation::
    
                >>> from mayavi import mlab
                >>> @mlab.animate
                ... def anim():
                ...     f = mlab.gcf()
                ...     while 1:
                ...         f.scene.camera.azimuth(10)
                ...         f.scene.render()
                ...         yield
                ...
                >>> a = anim() # Starts the animation.
    
            For more specialized use you can pass arguments to the decorator::
    
                >>> from mayavi import mlab
                >>> @mlab.animate(delay=500, ui=False)
                ... def anim():
                ...     f = mlab.gcf()
                ...     while 1:
                ...         f.scene.camera.azimuth(10)
                ...         f.scene.render()
                ...         yield
                ...
                >>> a = anim() # Starts the animation without a UI.
    
            **Notes**
    
            If you want to modify the data plotted by an `mlab` function call,
            please refer to the section on: :ref:`mlab-animating-data`.

set_engine
~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: set_engine(self, engine)

    Sets the mlab engine.
    

    


show
~~~~

.. function:: show(func=None, stop=False)

    Start interacting with the figure.
    
    By default, this function simply creates a GUI and starts its
    event loop if needed.
    
    If it is used as a decorator, then it may be used to decorate a
    function which requires a UI.   If the GUI event loop is already
    running it simply runs the function.  If not the event loop is
    started and function is run in the toolkit's event loop.  The choice
    of UI is via `ETSConfig.toolkit`.
    
    If the argument stop is set to True then it pops up a UI where the
    user can stop the event loop.  Subsequent calls to `show` will
    restart the event loop.
    
    **Parameters**
    
      :stop:  A boolean which specifies if a UI dialog is displayed which
              allows the event loop to be stopped.
    
    **Examples**
    
    Here is a simple example demonstrating the use of show::
    
      >>> from mayavi import mlab
      >>> mlab.test_contour3d()
      >>> mlab.show()
    
    You can stop interaction via a simple pop up UI like so::
    
      >>> mlab.test_contour3d()
      >>> mlab.show(stop=True)
    
    The decorator can be used like so::
    
      >>> @mlab.show
      ... def do():
      ...    mlab.test_contour3d()
      ...
      >>> do()
    
    The decorator can also be passed the stop argument::
    
      >>> @mlab.show(stop=True)
      ... def do():
      ...    mlab.test_contour3d()
      ...
      >>> do()

    edit graphicaly the properties of the different objects on
    the scenes.
    

    


start_recording
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: start_recording(ui=True)
