=======

array2d_source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: array2d_source(*args, **kwargs)

    
    Creates structured 2D data from a 2D array.
    
    **Function signatures**::
    
        array2d_source(s, ...)
        array2d_source(x, y, s, ...)
        array2d_source(x, y, f, ...)
    
    If 3 positional arguments are passed the last one must be an array s,
    or a callable, f, that returns an array. x and y give the
    coordinnates of positions corresponding to the s values.
    
    x and y can be 1D or 2D arrays (such as returned by numpy.ogrid or
    numpy.mgrid), but the points should be located on an orthogonal grid
    (possibly non-uniform). In other words, all the points sharing a same
    index in the s array need to have the same x or y value.
    
    If only 1 array s is passed the x and y arrays are assumed to be
    made from the indices of arrays, and an uniformly-spaced data set is
    created.
    
    **Keyword arguments**:
    
        :name: the name of the vtk object created.
    
        :figure: optionally, the figure on which to add the data source.
                 If None, the source is not added to any figure, and will
                 be added automatically by the modules or
                 filters. If False, no figure will be created by modules
                 or filters applied to the source: the source can only
                 be used for testing, or numerical algorithms, not
                 visualization.
    
        :mask: Mask points specified in a boolean masking array.

    Creates 2D grid data.
    
    x, y, z are 2D arrays giving the positions of the vertices of the surface.
    The connectivity between these points is implied by the connectivity on
    the arrays.
    
    For simple structures (such as orthogonal grids) prefer the array2dsource
    function, as it will create more efficient data structures.
    
    **Keyword arguments**:
    
        :name: the name of the vtk object created.
    
        :scalars: optional scalar data.
    
        :figure: optionally, the figure on which to add the data source.
                 If None, the source is not added to any figure, and will
                 be added automatically by the modules or
                 filters. If False, no figure will be created by modules
                 or filters applied to the source: the source can only
                 be used for testing, or numerical algorithms, not
                 visualization.
    
        :mask: Mask points specified in a boolean masking array.

        line_source(x, y, z, f, ...)
    
        If 4 positional arguments are passed the last one must be an array s,
        or a callable, f, that returns an array.
    
    **Keyword arguments**:
    
        :name: the name of the vtk object created.
    
        :figure: optionally, the figure on which to add the data source.
                 If None, the source is not added to any figure, and will
                 be added automatically by the modules or
                 filters. If False, no figure will be created by modules
                 or filters applied to the source: the source can only
                 be used for testing, or numerical algorithms, not
                 visualization.

    If only 1 array s is passed the x, y and z arrays are assumed to be
    made from the indices of arrays.
    
    If the x, y and z arrays are passed they are supposed to have been

        :figure: optionally, the figure on which to add the data source.
                 If None, the source is not added to any figure, and will
                 be added automatically by the modules or
                 filters. If False, no figure will be created by modules
                 or filters applied to the source: the source can only

        vertical_vectors_source(x, y, z, s, ...)
        vertical_vectors_source(x, y, z, f, ...)
    
    If only one positional argument is passed, it can be a 1D, 2D, or 3D
