Plotting functions
==================

barchart
~~~~~~~~

.. function:: barchart(*args, **kwargs)

    
    Plots vertical glyphs (like bars) scaled vertical, to do
    histogram-like plots.
    
    This functions accepts a wide variety of inputs, with positions given
    in 2-D or in 3-D.
    
    **Function signatures**::
    
        barchart(s, ...)
        barchart(x, y, s, ...)
        barchart(x, y, f, ...)
        barchart(x, y, z, s, ...)
        barchart(x, y, z, f, ...)
    
    If only one positional argument is passed, it can be a 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D
    array giving the length of the vectors. The positions of the data
    points are deducted from the indices of array, and an
    uniformly-spaced data set is created.
    
    If 3 positional arguments (x, y, s) are passed the last one must be
    an array s, or a callable, f, that returns an array. x and y give the
    2D coordinates of positions corresponding to the s values.
    
    If 4 positional arguments (x, y, z, s) are passed, the 3 first are
    arrays giving the 3D coordinates of the data points, and the last one
    is an array s, or a callable, f, that returns an array giving the
    data value.

    scalars is a 3D numpy arrays giving the data on a grid.
    
    If 4 arrays, (x, y, z, scalars) are passed, the 3 first arrays give
    the position of the arrows, and the last the scalar value. The x, y
    and z arrays are then supposed to have been generated by
    `numpy.mgrid`, in other words, they are 3D arrays, with positions
    lying on a 3D orthogonal and regularly spaced grid with nearest
    neighbor in space matching nearest neighbor in the array. The
    function builds a scalar field assuming  the points are regularly
    spaced.
    
    If 4 positional arguments, (x, y, z, f) are passed, the last one
    can also be a callable, f, that returns vectors components (u, v, w)

        :extent: [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax]
                 Default is the x, y, z arrays extent. Use

    are lines of equal s value.
    
    x and y can be 1D or 2D arrays (such as returned by numpy.ogrid or

    (possibly non-uniform). In other words, all the points sharing a same
    index in the s array need to have the same x or y value. For
    arbitrary-shaped position arrays (non-orthogonal grids), see the mesh
    function.
    
    If only 1 array s is passed, the x and y arrays are assumed to be
    made from the indices of arrays, and an uniformly-spaced data set is
    created.
    
    If 3 positional arguments are passed the last one must be an array s,
    or a callable, f, that returns an array. x and y give the

        :figure: Figure to populate.
    
        :line_width:  The width of the lines, if any used. Must be a float.

        :vmin: vmin is used to scale the colormap.
               If None, the min of the data will be used
    
        :warp_scale: scale of the warp scalar
    

    
**Example** (run in ``ipython -wthread``, ``ipython --gui=wx`` for recent
IPython versions, or in the mayavi2 interactive shell,

.. function:: surf(*args, **kwargs)

    
    Plots a surface using regularly-spaced elevation data supplied as a 2D
    array.
    
    **Function signatures**::
    
        surf(s, ...)
        surf(x, y, s, ...)
        surf(x, y, f, ...)
    
    s is the elevation matrix, a 2D array, where indices along the first
    array axis represent x locations, and indices along the second array
    axis represent y locations.
    
    x and y can be 1D or 2D arrays such as returned by numpy.ogrid or
    numpy.mgrid. Arrays returned by numpy.meshgrid require a transpose
    first to obtain correct indexing order.
    The points should be located on an orthogonal grid (possibly
    non-uniform). In other words, all the points sharing a same
    index in the s array need to have the same x or y value. For
    arbitrary-shaped position arrays (non-orthogonal grids), see the mesh
    function.
    
    If only 1 array s is passed, the x and y arrays are assumed to be
    made from the indices of arrays, and an uniformly-spaced data set is
    created.
    
    If 3 positional arguments are passed the last one must be an array s,
    or a callable, f, that returns an array. x and y give the
    coordinates of positions corresponding to the s values.
    
    **Keyword arguments:**
    
        :color: the color of the vtk object. Overides the colormap,
                if any, when specified. This is specified as a

        :representation: the representation type used for the surface. Must be
                         'surface' or 'wireframe' or 'points'. Default:
                         surface
    
        :reset_zoom: Reset the zoom to accomodate the data newly
                     added to the scene. Defaults to True.
    
        :transparent: make the opacity of the actor depend on the
                      scalar.
    
        :vmax: vmax is used to scale the colormap.
               If None, the max of the data will be used
    
        :vmin: vmin is used to scale the colormap.
               If None, the min of the data will be used
    
        :warp_scale: scale of the z axis (warped from
                     the value of the scalar). By default this scale
                     is a float value.                          If you specify
                     'auto', the scale is calculated to
                     give a pleasant aspect ratio to the plot,
                     whatever the bounds of the data.
                     If you specify a value for warp_scale in
                     addition to an extent, the warp scale will be
                     determined by the warp_scale, and the plot be
                     positioned along the z axis with the zero of the
                     data centered on the center of the extent. If you
                     are using explicit extents, this is the best way
                     to control the vertical scale of your plots.
                     If you want to control the extent (or range)
                     of the surface object, rather than its scale,
                     see the `extent` keyword argument.

triangular_mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: triangular_mesh(*args, **kwargs)

    
    Plots a surface using a mesh defined by the position of its vertices
    and the triangles connecting them.
    
    **Function signatures**::
    
        triangular_mesh(x, y, z, triangles ...)
    
    x, y, z are arrays giving the positions of the vertices of the surface.
    triangles is a list of triplets (or an array) list the vertices in
    each triangle. Vertices are indexes by their appearance number in the
    position arrays.
    
    For simple structures (such as rectangular grids) prefer the surf or
    mesh functions, as they will create more efficient data structures.
    
    
    **Keyword arguments:**
    
        :color: the color of the vtk object. Overides the colormap,
                if any, when specified. This is specified as a
                triplet of float ranging from 0 to 1, eg (1, 1,
                1) for white.
    
        :colormap: type of colormap to use.
    
        :extent: [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax]
                 Default is the x, y, z arrays extent. Use
                 this to change the extent of the object
                 created.
    
        :figure: Figure to populate.
    
        :line_width:  The width of the lines, if any used. Must be a float.
