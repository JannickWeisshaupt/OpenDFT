Introduction into OpenDFT
#########################

OpenDFT is a free and open source software that brings cutting edge solid state research to the people. It is a graphical program that
interacts with various scientific terminal based solid state software packages. It visualizes inputs, such as the crystal structure and
outputs, such as band structures and optical spectra and can start and control calculations, which are done by the respective scientific
solid state package. OpenDFT is designed to be DFT engine agnostic so that you can easily switch between different scientific codes and
compare results seamlessly.
